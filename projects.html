	<h1>Projects</h1>
	<p>Some things I used to do but don't do much of any more because I have a day job</p>
</div>

<div class="projectbox">
	<h2>Phrond</h2>

	<a href="http://phrond.com" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://phrond.com/sites/all/themes/phrond/phrondlogo.svg" class="imgleft" width="100px"></a>

	<a href="http://phrond.com" rel="nofollow">Phrond</a> - project on hold. Will get back to this one.
</div>

<div class="projectbox">
	<h2>Photographic Dictionary</h2>

	<a href="http://photographicdictionary.com" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://photographicdictionary.com/images/photo-logo.png" class="imgleft"></a>

	<a href="http://photographicdictionary.com" rel="nofollow">Photographic dictionary</a> is a site illustrating common words with photos. Optimistically I may extend this to AI generated pictures.
</div>

<div class="projectbox">
	<h2>Words, by cat</h2>

	<a href="https://wordsbycat.com" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://wordsbycat.com/images/menu/a.png" class="imgleft"></a>

	<a href="https://wordsbycat.com" rel="nofollow">Words, by cat</a> is where the overflow from the Photographic Dictionary goes, if it has cats. I haven't updated this one for ages but it's now public on github if anyone has cat photos and wants to make a PR.
</div>

<div class="projectbox">
	<h2>Giraffian</h2>

	<a href="http://giraffian.com" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://giraffian.com/images/gir-logo.png" class="imgleft"></a>

	<a href="http://giraffian.com" rel="nofollow">Giraffian</a> is an old site with various childen's activities on it, but mostly has a collection of little kid's jokes. Site dates back to 2002 and has been rebuilt in a variety of technologies over the years. Currently in the process of archiving it to static HTML like all my other older sites.

<div class="projectbox">
	<h2>Stancartoons</h2>

	<a href="http://stancartoons.com" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://giraffian.com/images/gir-logo.png" class="imgleft"></a>

	<a href="http://stancartoons.com" rel="nofollow">Stancartoons</a> is my father's site, since he's found facebook he hasn't been using this. Like all the others I need to get them off Drupal and onto something else.
