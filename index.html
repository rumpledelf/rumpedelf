Hi, I'm RumpledElf. I live in southern Sydney, Australia and I work for a data analytics company called <a href="http://astuteinformatics.com.au">Astute Informatics</a>. I am quite self-admittedly a very strange person. In the long term I  am aiming for eccentric but I don't yet have that much money nor that many cats.
</p></p>
I'm a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/rumpledelf">Drupal developer</a> but I'm trying to give it up and spend more time away from the computer (it isn't working). I started my career as a C programmer and at some point I found web development and never looked back. I like making things and fixing things and web development has that lovely mix of instant gratification and larger scale architecture.
</p></p>
I've been using this nick fairly consistently for almost 20 years, so if you find this nickname somewhere, odds are good it is me. This page is just here as a meta page for people who google me. I have opinions about lots of things - and I get passionate about many of them. Not all of them are work related. Fortunately for the people I work with there isn't much overlap, I have some dubious hobbies.
</p><p>
My least dubious hobby is collecting awful, awful real estate. The only thing I can say in my defence is they are very cheap. I've been doing this since I was still at uni and there is no hope for me. I bought the latest one in early 2016 and watch this space for a blog on its progress.
</p></p>
If you absolutely must stalk me on other social media, may I suggest <a href="https://twitter.com/RumpledElf">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/stanleyr">LinkedIn</a> as good places to start. I would link to my GitHub but the only public projects I have are a collection of Jekyll sites that are not much different to this one, and if you're impressed by this site, you have low standards.
